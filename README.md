# to-do-list

I've used a Bootstrap layout to keep the page appearance simple and responsive.

Whilst building this project I was still developing my DOM control to allow me to apply my Javascript knowledge to practical applications.

I had a few bugs in my initial code that I've since ironed out. I'd attempted to use for loops which had made things more complicated than they needed to be and resulted in problems with certain button functionality.

My aim is for the code to be as simple as possible to achieve my desired tasks.
